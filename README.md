NodeJs code running Raspberry PI pushes sensors events to Aercloud using REST APIs.

A data model and container is created on Aeris Aercloud data cloud platform. Once created, sensor data is pushed using container REST API to Aercloud.

React-Native mobile app (index.android.js and resources folder to be copied to your react-native project folder), build and deploy on Android phone. This fetches events from Aercloud container and shows them on app.
